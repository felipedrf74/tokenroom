# Tokenroom

AI usage for 19 providers: a macOS menu-bar app that reads each tool's login, plus an iPhone app with widgets and a Live Activity, and an Apple Watch app with complications, fed through the user's private iCloud. Formerly Headroom (renamed in 2.0; `LegacyMigration` imports Headroom 1.x settings).

Read `.grok/skills/tokenroom-macos/SKILL.md` before changing the Mac app's UI, tokens, MenuBarExtra behavior, or provider adapters, and `.grok/skills/tokenroom-apple/SKILL.md` before changing the iPhone, widgets, Watch, alerts, or the iCloud relay. Those skills are the source of truth.

Do not put personal names, emails, user IDs, or tokens in source, fixtures, logs, or the snapshot cache. Bundle ID is `app.tokenroom.mac`.

## Build

Xcode 27 is preferred. `./scripts/build.sh` falls back to `swiftc` when Xcode is not installed.

```bash
./scripts/build.sh
```

DerivedData must stay local (`~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/Tokenroom`). Do not let Xcode put build products in the source tree.

Build settings live in `Config/*.xcconfig`, not in `project.pbxproj`. Never add `DEVELOPMENT_TEAM` or `CODE_SIGN_*` to the project file: they would override `Config/Local.xcconfig` (git-ignored; team ID and `TOKENROOM_MAC_SIGNING`). `TOKENROOM_FORCE_SWIFTC=1 ./scripts/build.sh` checks the Command Line Tools fallback.

Tokenroom renews Claude, Grok Build, and Codex access tokens in each tool's own login and writes the new tokens back. It does not keep a separate copy, and it does not refresh any other provider.

## Test

```bash
xcodebuild test -project Tokenroom.xcodeproj -scheme Tokenroom -destination 'platform=macOS'
./scripts/typecheck-shared.sh
xcodebuild build -project Tokenroom.xcodeproj -scheme TokenroomMobile -destination 'generic/platform=iOS Simulator'
xcodebuild test -project Tokenroom.xcodeproj -scheme TokenroomMobile -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 18 Pro'
```

Shared logic (relay, alerts, ranking, parsers, forecasts) is tested on the Mac in `TokenroomTests`; `TokenroomMobileTests` covers what only the iPhone app does. The iPhone build also builds the widgets, the Watch app, and its complications. A debug Mac build renders its UI from sample data with `-TokenroomSnapshots <folder>`. CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`), on the newest Xcode on the runner (26 or 27), typechecks `Shared`, runs the Mac tests, builds the iPhone app, compiles `TokenroomMobileTests` without running them (they need a signed host with iCloud, App Group, and Keychain entitlements, so run them locally), and builds the Command Line Tools fallback (`TOKENROOM_FORCE_SWIFTC=1 ./scripts/build.sh`).
